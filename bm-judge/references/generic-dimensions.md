# Generic Evaluation Dimensions (D1–D8)

Detailed scoring rubrics, examples, and criteria for the eight generic skill evaluation dimensions.

---

## D1: Knowledge Delta (20 points) — THE CORE DIMENSION

The most important dimension. Does the Skill add genuine expert knowledge?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-5 | Explains basics Claude knows (what is X, how to write code, standard library tutorials) |
| 6-10 | Mixed: some expert knowledge diluted by obvious content |
| 11-15 | Mostly expert knowledge with minimal redundancy |
| 16-20 | Pure knowledge delta — every paragraph earns its tokens |

**Red flags** (instant score ≤5):
- "What is [basic concept]" sections
- Step-by-step tutorials for standard operations
- Explaining how to use common libraries
- Generic best practices ("write clean code", "handle errors")
- Definitions of industry-standard terms

**Green flags** (indicators of high knowledge delta):
- Decision trees for non-obvious choices ("when X fails, try Y because Z")
- Trade-offs only an expert would know ("A is faster but B handles edge case C")
- Edge cases from real-world experience
- "NEVER do X because [non-obvious reason]"
- Domain-specific thinking frameworks

**Evaluation questions**:
1. For each section, ask: "Does Claude already know this?"
2. If explaining something, ask: "Is this explaining TO Claude or FOR Claude?"
3. Count paragraphs that are Expert vs Activation vs Redundant

## D2: Mindset + Appropriate Procedures (15 points)

Does the Skill transfer expert **thinking patterns** along with **necessary domain-specific procedures**?

The difference between experts and novices isn't "knowing how to operate" — it's "how to think about the problem." But thinking patterns alone aren't enough when Claude lacks domain-specific procedural knowledge.

**Key distinction**:
| Type | Example | Value |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Thinking patterns** | "Before designing, ask: What makes this memorable?" | High — shapes decision-making |
| **Domain-specific procedures** | "OOXML workflow: unpack → edit XML → validate → pack" | High — Claude may not know this |
| **Generic procedures** | "Step 1: Open file, Step 2: Edit, Step 3: Save" | Low — Claude already knows |

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-3 | Only generic procedures Claude already knows |
| 4-7 | Has domain procedures but lacks thinking frameworks |
| 8-11 | Good balance: thinking patterns + domain-specific workflows |
| 12-15 | Expert-level: shapes thinking AND provides procedures Claude wouldn't know |

**What counts as valuable procedures**:
- Workflows Claude hasn't been trained on (new tools, proprietary systems)
- Correct ordering that's non-obvious (e.g., "validate BEFORE packing, not after")
- Critical steps that are easy to miss (e.g., "MUST recalculate formulas after editing")
- Domain-specific sequences (e.g., MCP server's 4-phase development process)

**What counts as redundant procedures**:
- Generic file operations (open, read, write, save)
- Standard programming patterns (loops, conditionals, error handling)
- Common library usage that's well-documented

**Expert thinking patterns look like**:
```markdown
Before [action], ask yourself:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this solve? Who uses it?
- **Constraints**: What are the hidden requirements?
- **Differentiation**: What makes this solution memorable?
```

**The test**:
1. Does it tell Claude WHAT to think about? (thinking patterns)
2. Does it tell Claude HOW to do things it wouldn't know? (domain procedures)

A good Skill provides both when needed.

## D3: Anti-Pattern Quality (15 points)

Does the Skill have effective NEVER lists?

**Why this matters**: Half of expert knowledge is knowing what NOT to do. A senior designer sees purple gradient on white background and instinctively cringes — "too AI-generated." This intuition for "what absolutely not to do" comes from stepping on countless landmines.

Claude hasn't stepped on these landmines. Good Skills must explicitly state these "absolute don'ts."

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-3 | No anti-patterns mentioned |
| 4-7 | Generic warnings ("avoid errors", "be careful", "consider edge cases") |
| 8-11 | Specific NEVER list with some reasoning |
| 12-15 | Expert-grade anti-patterns with WHY — things only experience teaches |

**Expert anti-patterns** (specific + reason):
```markdown
NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial)
- Cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Default border-radius on everything
```

**Weak anti-patterns** (vague, no reasoning):
```markdown
Avoid making mistakes.
Be careful with edge cases.
Don't write bad code.
```

**The test**: Would an expert read the anti-pattern list and say "yes, I learned this the hard way"? Or would they say "this is obvious to everyone"?

---

## D4: Specification Compliance — Especially Description (15 points)

Does the Skill follow official format requirements? **Special focus on description quality.**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-5 | Missing frontmatter or invalid format |
| 6-10 | Has frontmatter but description is vague or incomplete |
| 11-13 | Valid frontmatter, description has WHAT but weak on WHEN |
| 14-15 | Perfect: comprehensive description with WHAT, WHEN, and trigger keywords |

**Frontmatter requirements**:
- `name`: lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphens only, ≤64 characters
- `description`: **THE MOST CRITICAL FIELD** — determines if skill gets used at all

**Why description is THE MOST IMPORTANT field**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SKILL ACTIVATION FLOW                                              │
│                                                                     │
│  User Request → Agent sees ALL skill descriptions → Decides which  │
│                 (only descriptions, not bodies!)     to activate    │
│                                                                     │
│  If description doesn't match → Skill NEVER gets loaded            │
│  If description is vague → Skill might not trigger when it should  │
│  If description lacks keywords → Skill is invisible to the Agent   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Description must answer THREE questions**:

1. **WHAT**: What does this Skill do? (functionality)
2. **WHEN**: In what situations should it be used? (trigger scenarios)
3. **KEYWORDS**: What terms should trigger this Skill? (searchable terms)

**Description quality checklist**:
- [ ] Lists specific capabilities (not just "helps with X")
- [ ] Includes explicit trigger scenarios ("Use when...", "When user asks for...")
- [ ] Contains searchable keywords (file extensions, domain terms, action verbs)
- [ ] Specific enough that Agent knows EXACTLY when to use it
- [ ] Includes scenarios where this skill MUST be used (not just "can be used")

## D5: Progressive Disclosure (15 points)

Does the Skill implement proper content layering?

Skill loading has three layers:
```
Layer 1: Metadata (always in memory)
         Only name + description
         ~100 tokens per skill

Layer 2: SKILL.md Body (loaded after triggering)
         Detailed guidelines, code examples, decision trees
         Ideal: < 500 lines

Layer 3: Resources (loaded on demand)
         scripts/, references/, assets/
         No limit
```

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-5 | Everything dumped in SKILL.md (>500 lines, no structure) |
| 6-10 | Has references but unclear when to load them |
| 11-13 | Good layering with MANDATORY triggers present |
| 14-15 | Perfect: decision trees + explicit triggers + "Do NOT Load" guidance |

**For Skills WITH references directory**, check Loading Trigger Quality:

| Trigger Quality | Characteristics |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Poor | References listed at end, no loading guidance |
| Mediocre | Some triggers but not embedded in workflow |
| Good | MANDATORY triggers in workflow steps |
| Excellent | Scenario detection + conditional triggers + "Do NOT Load" |

**For simple Skills** (no references, <100 lines): Score based on conciseness and self-containment.

## D6: Freedom Calibration (15 points)

Is the level of specificity appropriate for the task's fragility?

Different tasks need different levels of constraint. This is about matching freedom to fragility.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-5 | Severely mismatched (rigid scripts for creative tasks, vague for fragile ops) |
| 6-10 | Partially appropriate, some mismatches |
| 11-13 | Good calibration for most scenarios |
| 14-15 | Perfect freedom calibration throughout |

**The freedom spectrum**:

| Task Type | Should Have | Why | Example Skill |
|-----------|-------------|-----|---------------|
| Creative/Design | High freedom | Multiple valid approaches, differentiation is value | frontend-design |
| Code review | Medium freedom | Principles exist but judgment required | code-review |
| File format operations | Low freedom | One wrong byte corrupts file, consistency critical | docx, xlsx, pdf |

**The test**: Ask "if Agent makes a mistake, what's the consequence?"
- High consequence → Low freedom
- Low consequence → High freedom

---

## D7: Pattern Recognition (10 points)

Does the Skill follow an established official pattern?

Through analyzing 17 official Skills, we identified 5 main design patterns:

| Pattern | ~Lines | Key Characteristics | Example | When to Use |
|---------|--------|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Mindset** | ~50 | Thinking > technique, strong NEVER list, high freedom | frontend-design | Creative tasks requiring taste |
| **Navigation** | ~30 | Minimal SKILL.md, routes to sub-files | internal-comms | Multiple distinct scenarios |
| **Philosophy** | ~150 | Two-step: Philosophy → Express, emphasizes craft | canvas-design | Art/creation requiring originality |
| **Process** | ~200 | Phased workflow, checkpoints, medium freedom | mcp-builder | Complex multi-step projects |
| **Tool** | ~300 | Decision trees, code examples, low freedom | docx, pdf, xlsx | Precise operations on specific formats |

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-3 | No recognizable pattern, chaotic structure |
| 4-6 | Partially follows a pattern with significant deviations |
| 7-8 | Clear pattern with minor deviations |
| 9-10 | Masterful application of appropriate pattern |

---

## D8: Practical Usability (15 points)

Can an Agent actually use this Skill effectively?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-5 | Confusing, incomplete, contradictory, or untested guidance |
| 6-10 | Usable but with noticeable gaps |
| 11-13 | Clear guidance for common cases |
| 14-15 | Comprehensive coverage including edge cases and error handling |

**Check for**:
- **Decision trees**: For multi-path scenarios, is there clear guidance on which path to take?
- **Code examples**: Do they actually work? Or are they pseudocode that breaks?
- **Error handling**: What if the main approach fails? Are fallbacks provided?
- **Edge cases**: Are unusual but realistic scenarios covered?
- **Actionability**: Can Agent immediately act, or needs to figure things out?
