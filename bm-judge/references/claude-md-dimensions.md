# CLAUDE.md / System Prompt Evaluation Dimensions (C1–C3)

Detailed scoring rubrics for dimensions that apply when evaluating CLAUDE.md files or system prompts — any prompt that governs LLM behavioral settings rather than teaching domain skills.

---

## C1: Behavioral Clarity (15 points)

Are instructions unambiguous, internally consistent, and non-contradictory?

The core failure mode for CLAUDE.md-style prompts is not redundancy (as in Skills) but **ambiguity** — when the model encounters a situation that two instructions govern differently, it picks one arbitrarily. The author never finds out.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0–5 | Contradictory instructions, or so vague the model must guess intent |
| 6–10 | Mostly clear but some instructions conflict or use inconsistent language |
| 11–13 | Clear throughout, minor ambiguity in edge cases |
| 14–15 | Unambiguous, consistent vocabulary, zero contradictions |

**What to check**:
- [ ] Do any two instructions govern the same scenario with different outcomes?
- [ ] Is MUST/NEVER/SHOULD/MAY used consistently with the same meaning throughout?
- [ ] Are conditional instructions ("if X, then Y") complete — do they cover the else case when it matters?
- [ ] Are imperative and descriptive voice mixed in a way that's confusing? ("The assistant is helpful" vs. "Be helpful")
- [ ] Do sections added at different times now conflict with each other?

**Example of ambiguity failure**:
```
Section A: "Always ask for clarification before proceeding."
Section B: "Prefer action over asking — users find questions annoying."
```
The model will pick one contextually. The author intended both with different scopes, but neither section says so.

**Example of clarity**:
```
"When the task is ambiguous AND the consequence of guessing wrong is high
(destructive operations, external sends), ask for clarification.
For low-consequence ambiguity, make a reasonable assumption and proceed."
```

## C2: Scope Definition (15 points)

Does the prompt govern only what actually needs governing — and avoid over-specifying what the model handles well by default?

**The scope failure modes**:
1. **Over-scoped**: So many rules it becomes noise; real constraints get buried and ignored
2. **Under-scoped**: Leaves out genuine edge cases that cause repeated failures
3. **Wrong domain**: Governs something the model already does well, wasting tokens

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0–5 | Severely over- or under-scoped; rules for things the model already handles |
| 6–10 | Mostly appropriate scope with some waste or gaps |
| 11–13 | Well-scoped with minor issues |
| 14–15 | Governs exactly what needs governing; no redundant defaults |

**What to check**:
- [ ] Does it tell the model to do things it already does by default? (token waste)
- [ ] Are the rules clearly applicable to a specific context, or trying to govern everything?
- [ ] Is there a gap — a known failure mode in this domain that isn't covered?
- [ ] Do rules have enough context to know WHEN they apply vs. when they don't?

**Red flags** (over-scoping):
- "Be helpful and professional" — the model does this by default
- "Write clear, readable code" — model does this by default
- Rules for every conceivable edge case, including ones that never occur

**Red flags** (under-scoping):
- Known recurring failure modes not mentioned
- Rules that don't cover the cases where the model most often goes wrong
- Vague scope ("sometimes", "usually") where specificity matters

## C3: Structural Organization (10 points)

Can an LLM efficiently locate and apply the relevant rules during inference?

Unlike human readers who scan documents, LLMs process prompts sequentially. Structure affects which rules get weighted and which get lost.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0–3 | Prose walls, no sectioning, instructions buried mid-paragraph |
| 4–6 | Some structure but inconsistent; important rules mixed with minor ones |
| 7–8 | Clear sections, logical grouping, priority roughly communicated |
| 9–10 | Optimal: most critical rules prominent, consistent format throughout |

**What to check**:
- [ ] Are related instructions grouped together or scattered?
- [ ] Are the most important rules prominent (early, in dedicated sections, or marked)?
- [ ] Is the format consistent — headers, lists, or prose, not all three mixed arbitrarily?
- [ ] Is there duplication across sections? (contradictions often emerge from duplication)
- [ ] Would a new reader understand the priority ordering of rules?

**Good structural patterns**:
```markdown
## Critical (always applies)
- Rule with consequence

## Contextual (when X)
- Rule that applies in specific situations

## Preferences (when ambiguous)
- Default behavior when no other rule applies
```

**Anti-pattern — the prose wall**:
```markdown
When working with the codebase you should always make sure to follow
existing conventions and be careful not to break things and also remember
that tests are important and you should run them but also don't be too
slow and always ask when unsure except when it's obvious.
```
Packed with real instructions, but none will be applied reliably because none are distinct.
