# Common Failure Patterns

Failure patterns for all prompt types. Patterns 1–9 apply primarily to Skills. Patterns 10–13 apply to CLAUDE.md / system prompts. Patterns 14–15 apply to bash/shell guidance.

---

### Pattern 1: The Tutorial
```
Symptom: Explains what PDF is, how Python works, basic library usage
Root cause: Author assumes Skill should "teach" the model
Fix: Claude already knows this. Delete all basic explanations.
     Focus on expert decisions, trade-offs, and anti-patterns.
```

### Pattern 2: The Dump
```
Symptom: SKILL.md is 800+ lines with everything included
Root cause: No progressive disclosure design
Fix: Core routing and decision trees in SKILL.md (<300 lines ideal)
     Detailed content in references/, loaded on-demand
```

### Pattern 3: The Orphan References
```
Symptom: References directory exists but files are never loaded
Root cause: No explicit loading triggers
Fix: Add "MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE" at workflow decision points
     Add "Do NOT Load" to prevent over-loading
```

### Pattern 4: The Checkbox Procedure
```
Symptom: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3... mechanical procedures
Root cause: Author thinks in procedures, not thinking frameworks
Fix: Transform into "Before doing X, ask yourself..."
     Focus on decision principles, not operation sequences
```

### Pattern 5: The Vague Warning
```
Symptom: "Be careful", "avoid errors", "consider edge cases"
Root cause: Author knows things can go wrong but hasn't articulated specifics
Fix: Specific NEVER list with concrete examples and non-obvious reasons
     "NEVER use X because [specific problem that takes experience to learn]"
```

### Pattern 6: The Invisible Skill
```
Symptom: Great content but skill rarely gets activated
Root cause: Description is vague, missing keywords, or lacks trigger scenarios
Fix: Description must answer WHAT, WHEN, and include KEYWORDS
     "Use when..." + specific scenarios + searchable terms

Example fix:
BAD:  "Helps with document tasks"
GOOD: "Create, edit, and analyze .docx files. Use when working with
       Word documents, tracked changes, or professional document formatting."
```

### Pattern 7: The Wrong Location
```
Symptom: "When to use this Skill" section in body, not in description
Root cause: Misunderstanding of three-layer loading
Fix: Move all triggering information to description field
     Body is only loaded AFTER triggering decision is made
```

### Pattern 8: The Over-Engineered
```
Symptom: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md
Root cause: Treating Skill like a software project
Fix: Delete all auxiliary files. Only include what Agent needs for the task.
     No documentation about the Skill itself.
```

### Pattern 9: The Freedom Mismatch
```
Symptom: Rigid scripts for creative tasks, vague guidance for fragile operations
Root cause: Not considering task fragility
Fix: High freedom for creative (principles, not steps)
     Low freedom for fragile (exact scripts, no parameters)
```

### Pattern 10: The Contradiction (CLAUDE.md / system prompts)
```
Symptom: Two sections govern the same scenario with different outcomes
Root cause: Rules added incrementally without auditing existing rules
Fix: Before adding a rule, search for existing rules on the same topic
     When conflict found, make scope explicit: "when X, prefer A; when Y, prefer B"
```

### Pattern 11: The Default Restatement (CLAUDE.md / system prompts)
```
Symptom: Rules that tell the model to do what it already does by default
         ("Be helpful", "write clear code", "handle errors properly")
Root cause: Author writing rules without asking "would Claude do this anyway?"
Fix: Test each rule by asking "does Claude do this without being told?"
     If yes, delete it — it wastes tokens and dilutes the real rules
```

### Pattern 12: The Scope Wall (CLAUDE.md / system prompts)
```
Symptom: Dozens of rules covering every conceivable situation
Root cause: Trying to eliminate all uncertainty through exhaustive rules
Fix: Cover the 5–10 failure modes that actually recur; trust model defaults elsewhere
     When rules become noise, the important ones stop getting applied
```

### Pattern 13: The Prose Wall (CLAUDE.md / system prompts)
```
Symptom: Rules buried in paragraphs with no sectioning or list structure
Root cause: Writing for human reading, not for LLM inference
Fix: Break into labeled sections, use bullet lists for distinct rules
     Each rule should be independently parseable, not buried mid-sentence
```

---

### Pattern 14: The Generic Shell Warning (bash/shell guidance)
```
Symptom: "Be careful with shell commands" / "avoid dangerous operations"
Root cause: Author knows bash can be risky but hasn't articulated the specific failure modes
Fix: Name the exact construct (&&, |, $(), heredoc) and the exact failure in this environment
     Generic warnings get ignored; specific rules get followed
```

### Pattern 15: The Missing Alternative (bash/shell guidance)
```
Symptom: NEVER rule with no replacement — "don't do X" but not "do Y instead"
Root cause: Author focused on prohibition, not on enabling correct behavior
Fix: Every NEVER should have an instead: "NEVER use pipe — redirect to temp file with > and read back"
     Without an alternative, agent either ignores the rule or gets stuck
```
