# Skill Forge Audit

Batch-run skill-forge-judge across every skill in the repo. One consolidated report — grades, top issues, priority order. Read-only: no fixes applied.

Requires `skill-forge-judge` to be installed.

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Discover

Glob for all SKILL.md files under the project root:

```
pattern: */SKILL.md
```

Collect the directory name of each match — that's the skill name.

To detect skipped directories: also Glob `*/` to list all top-level directories. Any directory in the `*/` result that is not in the `*/SKILL.md` result has no SKILL.md — list it in the Skipped section of the report with reason "No SKILL.md found".

If zero SKILL.md files found: output "No skills found in this repo." and stop.

### Phase 2 — Evaluate

For each discovered skill, in order:

1. Read the SKILL.md file at its absolute path.
2. Invoke `/skill-forge-judge` on it.
3. From the judge output, extract and record:
   - Skill name
   - Grade (A/B/C/D/F)
   - Score (X/Y, Z%)
   - Numbered Improvements items 1–5 (or all if fewer than 5)

Emit a one-line status per skill as each evaluation completes — do not wait until all are done:
```
✓ skill-forge-create   B  (87/120, 73%)
✓ skill-forge-hitl     C  (74/120, 62%)
```

If `/skill-forge-judge` is not installed: output "skill-forge-judge is required — install it before running skill-forge-audit." and stop.

If a skill's judge run errors: record `ERR` and the error message for that skill; continue to the next skill. Do not abort the audit.

### Phase 3 — Render Report

Sort results by grade ascending: F → D → C → B → A. Worst grades appear first — the report is a priority queue, not an alphabetical list.

Split skills into two groups:
- **Needs Work**: grade below B (< 80%)
- **Passing**: grade B or above (≥ 80%)

Output a single markdown report:

````markdown
# Skill Forge Audit
_<YYYY-MM-DD> — <N> skills evaluated_

## Grade Summary

| Skill | Grade | Score |
|-------|-------|-------|
| skill-forge-X | F | 55/120 (46%) |
| skill-forge-Y | C | 78/120 (65%) |
| skill-forge-Z | B | 98/120 (82%) |

## Needs Work

### skill-forge-X — F (55/120, 46%)

1. <improvement 1 from judge>
2. <improvement 2>
3. <improvement 3>

### skill-forge-Y — C (78/120, 65%)

1. <improvement 1>
2. <improvement 2>

## Passing (B+)

| Skill | Grade | Score |
|-------|-------|-------|
| skill-forge-Z | B | 98/120 (82%) |

## Skipped

| Directory | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| some-dir  | No SKILL.md found |
````

If all skills pass: omit the "Needs Work" section entirely.
If no skills pass: omit the "Passing" section.
If nothing was skipped: omit the "Skipped" section.

## NEVER

- **NEVER display full judge reports inline for each skill**
  **Instead:** Extract only grade, score, and top 1–5 numbered improvements per skill.
  **Why:** Unfiltered judge output for 6+ skills floods the context window and buries the aggregate signal the report exists to surface.

- **NEVER apply any fixes during an audit run**
  **Instead:** Output the report only. Direct the user to `/skill-forge-hitl` or `/skill-forge-update` for remediation.
  **Why:** Mixing diagnosis with treatment makes it impossible to know what the baseline was — the audit's value is the before-state snapshot.

- **NEVER sort by skill name or alphabetically**
  **Instead:** Sort by grade ascending (F first, A last) within each section.
  **Why:** Alphabetical sort buries the worst skills; the report's job is to surface where effort is needed most.

- **NEVER abort the audit when a single skill errors**
  **Instead:** Record `ERR` for that skill and continue to the next one.
  **Why:** A failed judge run on one skill should not discard results already collected for the others — partial results are more useful than none.
